## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Upload Resume**  
   Users upload their resume in `.pdf` or `.docx` format.

2. **Text Extraction**  
   The backend extracts text content using `pdf-parse` or `mammoth`.

3. **AI Analysis**  
   The extracted text is sent to an LLM (like Gemini or OpenAI) which returns a structured analysis.

   The frontend displays the feedback in a clean, readable format with sections like:
